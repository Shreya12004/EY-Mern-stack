    <h1><b><u>Vada Pav</u></b></h1>
    <p><i>Vada pav, alternatively spelt wada pao, (listenâ“˜) is a vegetarian fast food dish native to the Indian state of Maharashtra.[1] The dish consists of a deep-fried potato dumpling placed inside a bread bun (pav) sliced almost in half through the middle. It is generally accompanied with one or more chutneys and a green chili pepper.[2] Although it originated as an affordable street food in Mumbai, it is now served in food stalls and restaurants across India. It is also called Bombay burger[3] in keeping with its origins and its resemblance in physical form to a burger.[4]

        The most famous snack in Mumbai, vada pav is claimed to be a part of the culture of Mumbaikars.</i></P>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p><i>The most common theory of the vada pav's origin is that it was invented in the erstwhile mill-heartland of Central Mumbai. Ashok Vaidya of Dadar is often credited with starting the first vada pav stall outside Dadar railway station in 1966.Some sources credit Sudhakar Mhatre who started his business around the same time.[10] One of the earliest kiosks selling vada pav is said to be Khidki Vada Pav, located in Kalyan. It was started in the late 1960s by the Vaze family, who used to hand out vada pavs from a window (Khidki) of their house facing the road.[10]

        The carbohydrate-rich snack catered to the cotton mill workers of what was then known as Girangaon. This potato dumpling (batata vada) placed inside a pav was quick to make, cheap (~10-15 paisa in 1971[10][11]), and much convenient over the batata bhaji and chapati combination, which couldn't be eaten in overcrowded local trains</i></p>
    <h3>Preparation </h3>
    <p><i>Vada Pav is a popular street food from Maharashtra, made by sandwiching a spicy potato fritter (vada) between a soft bread roll (pav). To prepare, start by making the potato filling: mash boiled potatoes and season with mustard seeds, curry leaves, green chilies, turmeric, ginger-garlic paste, and salt. Shape this mixture into balls. Prepare a thick batter using gram flour, turmeric, red chili powder, and a pinch of baking soda. Dip the potato balls into the batter and deep-fry until golden. Assemble by slathering the pav with dry garlic chutney or tamarind chutney, placing the hot vada in between, and serve with fried green chilies for an authentic taste.</i></p>
